# Single-file-atlas-format
Since the regions in the mapZebrain are hierarchical, it would be possible to have a single tif (plus the hiearchy json), where each voxel encodes a value corresponding to the "lowest/smallest" hierarchy region that covers that voxel. There is an ability to decode the single tif file and generate all the masks on the user computer.
